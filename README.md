# fcgr-processing
A program for processing the results of testing samples for the rate of fatigue crack growth.
# Description
The program allows you to determine the properties of crack resistance in linear sections of the kinetic diagram of 
the fatigue crack development (Paris equation). Linear sections are determined by the iterative method.
The program allows you to automatically determine properties - without additional intervention. A manual processing 
method is also possible, which is necessary for conducting studies of crack development.
The GUI of the application is implemented, which allows the tester, engineer or designer to process the test results 
of samples without using code.

Additional information on using the program is provided in the program documents:
